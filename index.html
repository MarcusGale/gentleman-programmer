        Good Day! My name is Marcus Gale. Becoming a Software Engineer is no small feat, yet I have every desire to excel in a programming environment that pushes software beyond the capabilities the original developers imagined. I am eager to apply for an internship in the field of Computer Science. Since declaring this major at Queens College, I have aimed to become a software developer for a top-tier company within a year after graduation, where I can contribute to applications and projects in a professional setting rather than an academic one.

        <br>In preparation for this goal, I have participated in the AWS Academy at Queens College while seeking to enhance my programming skills through internship opportunities. I have learned much from my classes and even more through research and study for internship opportunities like this one. It became apparent that technical interviews for software development internships are rigorous and require disciplined preparation. I trust that an internship through CUNY Career Launch 2023 will advance my preparation.
        <br>
        An internship through CUNY in the computer science field will provide a solid foundation for achieving my career goal of becoming a Software Developer immediately after graduation. I am eager to be in a work environment that will provide the experience of computer programming to test my skills professionally. Such an environment will help catapult my skills and capacity to work cohesively with a team to achieve the company's goals.
        <br>
        I look forward to hearing from you!
        <br>

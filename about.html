                        I'm an aspiring software developer passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology. Since declaring my major in Computer Science at Queens College, I've been driven to join a top-tier company where I can contribute to innovative projects and applications.

                        With skills in Java, C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node.js, I'm actively seeking opportunities to enhance my expertise. Excelling in technical interviews requires dedication, and I'm committed to rigorous preparation.

                        I'm eager to work in an environment that challenges me to grow and collaborate with a dynamic team to achieve impactful goals. I look forward to contributing and learning in a professional setting.

<!--                    perform and excel in a programming environment that pushes software beyond the capabilities the original developers imagined.-->
<!--                    I am so pleased to be applying for this opportunity to acquire an internship in the particular field of Computer Science.-->
<!--                    Ever since I declared this as my major at Queens College, I have strived to reach my goal of becoming a software developer for a top-tier company within a year after graduation, where I can contribute to applications and projects in a professional setting rather than an academic one. In my preparation for this goal, I have found myself partaking in the AWS Academy that is offered at Queens College while simultaneously looking to grow in my proficiency in programming for several internship opportunities outside of the classroom. I have gained much from what I have learned in my classes but I have learned even more through research and study for an internship opportunity like this one. It became very apparent to me that the technical interviews for software developing internship is rigorous and requires disciplined preparation. I trust that an internship through CUNY Career Launch 2023 will only advance such preparation.-->



<!--                    The ability to acquire an internship through CUNY in industry and field of computer science will undoubtedly provide a solid foundation for me to accomplish my career goal of becoming a Software Developer directly after graduation. I earnestly desire to be in a work environment that will supply me with the proper experience of computer programming to put all I have learned to a professional test. Such an environment is conducive to catapult my skill and capacity to work with a team in cohesion to reach the desire goal of the company.-->
